the API was consumed succesfully, the principal page shows the most 20 popular movies
the search box (searchBox) takes the query that user writes there and show the coincidences ( max20 )
when a search is performed, it only shows the coincidences, popular movies dissapear 
movie cards have some information and additional they have a link (show more) to see more details
/details/id --> shows details like overview, duration and more
star filter only works with the coincidences of a search
footer contains git hub link


the design is a minimalist design and i think is really friendly with the user
i use some librarys like: react-router-dom, react-rating-stars-component
i use font awesome for the github icon
i use axios to make the request
